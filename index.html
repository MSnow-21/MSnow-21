        <p>Wolves are majestic animals that have a striking and intimidating look. A wolf typically travels in a pack, can consume a large amount of meat when feeding, and have a distinctive howl that helps them communication with other Wolves. Wolves are located in the popular Yellowstone park, the state of Alaska, and also in the midwest state of Michigan.</p>
